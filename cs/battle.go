// From: https://wiki.starsautohost.org/wiki/Guts_of_the_Battle_Engine
// ===================================================================
// Here are the guts of the battle engine as I understand it from both experience, observation and the help file
// (please pull me up on any points I get wrong)
//
// For a battle to take place 2 or more fleets (or a fleet and a starbase) must be at the same location and at
// least one of the fleets must be armed and have orders to attack ships of the others race (the type of ships
// involved doesn't matter). If are race has a fleet present at a location where there is a battle, but doesn't
// have orders to attack any of the other races there and none of the other races present has orders to attack it
// then it will not take part in the battle (and can not benefit from potential tech gain -- actually you can benefit
// from tech gain, a fact I learned from trying not to get the tech gain in a wolf/lamb tech exchange - LEit).
// Each ship present at the battle will form part of a token (AKA a stack), it is possible to have a token comprised
// of just a single ship. Tokens are always of ships of the same design. Each ship design in each fleet will create
// a token, splitting a few ships off to form a second fleet before the battle will create a second token on the
// battle board.
//
// The battle grid is made up of 10 squares by 10 squares. Each token is in a single square, there can be more
// than one token in the same square.There is an limit of 256 tokens per battle event for all players involved,
// if this limit is exceeded, then excess tokens will be left out (those created from fleets with the highest
// fleet numbers), in such a case each player will have an equal number of tokens, each player will be guaranteed
// to get their "share" of the available token slots (ie in a 4 race battle 256 / 4 = 64 token slots), if a race
// doesn't use up all their "slots" then they are shared equally between the other players.
//
// Each battle is made up of rounds. There are a maximum of 16 rounds in each battle. Each round has two parts,
// movement and shooting. Each token has a speed rating, and will be able to move between 0 and 3 squares in a
// single turn. If a token has a fractional speed rating then they will get a bonus square of movement every set
// number of turns. a 1/4 bonus means an extra square of movement on the first round and then on every fourth round
// after that starting with the fifth. A 1/2 speed bonus gets a bonus square of movement every other turn starting
// with the first, and a 3/4 speed bonus gets a bonus square of movement for the first three rounds of every 4 round
// cycle. The order of movement is this, each token with 3 movement squares moves a single square, then each token
// with 2+ movement moves a single square (if it had speed 3 then it would move for its second square) and then all
// ships with at least one square of movement move again. At each stage the ships with the most weight will move first
// though there is less than a 15% difference in weight then there is a chance that the lighter ship will go first.
// The smaller the weight % difference the greater the chance of the lighter ship going first.
//
// Each token has an attractiveness rating. This is used in both working out where ships move to and which ships are
// shot at first. The essence of the formula is cost / defence. A ship will have different attractiveness ratings
// verses different types of weapons (beams, sappers, torpedoes and capital missiles). Cost is calculated by summing
// the resource and boranium costs of the ship design used (iron and germ costs don't affect the attractiveness rating).
// Defence is calculated by the shield and armour dp modified by the enemies torpedo accuracy (after base accuracy,
// comps and jammers are worked out) if defending vs torps or capital missiles, the effects of double damage for unshielded
// targets vs capital missiles and the effects of deflectors against beam weapons. The attractiveness rating can be
// change during the course of the battle as shields and armour deplete. Attractiveness doesn't take into account the
// one missile one kill rule, thus chaff has become a fairly effective tactic.
//
// battle orders are comprised of 4 parts. A primary and secondary target type, legitimate races to attack and the tactic
// to use in battle. Ships will only attack tokens belonging to legitimate target races, however if another race present
// has any ships (including unarmed ships) with battles orders to attack your race then that race will also be considered
// a legitimate target. When attacking ships will try and shoot the most attractive ship of a type listed as a primary
// target and if no ships are available which are primary targets then the most attractive ship of a type listed as a
// secondary target will be targeted. Ships which are not listed as primary or secondary targets will not get shot at,
// even if they are shooting back.
//
// There are 6 different battle orders which determine the movement AI of the ships in battle, the movement AI is applied
// each time a ship wants to move a square on the battle board.:
//   - Disengage - If there is any enemy ship in firing range then move to any square further away than your current square.
//     If you are in range of an enemy weapon but cannot move further away then try move to a square that is of
//     the same distance away. If you are in range of the enemies weapons and cannot move away or maintain distance
//     then move to a random square. If you are not in range of the enemies weapons then move randomly. Also you
//     will try and disengage which will require 7 squares of movement to be clocked up before you can leave from
//     the battle board.
//   - Disengage if Challenged - Behaves like Maximise Damage until token takes damage and then behaves like Disengage.
//   - Minimise Damage to Self - (Not 100% sure on this one) If within range of an enemy weapon then move away from the
//     enemy (just like Disengage). If out of range of the enemies weapons or cannot move away from
//     the enemy then try and get in range of the best available target without moving towards the enemy.
//   - Maximise Net Damage - Locate most attractive primary target (or secondary if no primary targets are left). If out
//     of range with ANY weapon then move towards target. If in range with all weapons them move as to
//     maximise damage_done/damage_taken. The effect of this is if your weapons are longer range then
//     try to stay at maximum range. If your weapons range is the same then do random movement while
//     staying in range. If your weapons are shorter range and also beam weapons then attempt to close
//     in to zero range.
//   - Maximise Damage Ratio - As Maximise Net Damage but only considers the longest range weapon.
//   - Maximise Damage - Locate most attractive primary target (or secondary if no primary targets are left). If any of
//     your weapons are out of range of that token then keep moving to squares that are closer to it until
//     in range with all weapons. If using any beam weapons (as they have range dissipation) then attempt
//     to close to 0 range. If just using missiles or torps and in range then move randomly to a squares
//     still in range.
//
// Note that there is a bug when fighting starbases, the battle AI doesn't count the +1 range bonus when calculating movement.
// This mainly applies when your ships are attempting to get out of range of the enemy, so vs starbase with range 6 missiles,
// your ships will move to distance 7, the movement AI won't calculate that they are still in range even when they keep getting
// shot at.
// After the movement phase all ships will shoot their weapons, a token will fire all weapons from the same slot in a single
// shot. The weapon slot with the highest initiative will fire first. If there are two ships with slots of the same init,
// then the ships will be randomly given a priority over who can fire first (which will stick for the entire battle). The
// rest of the weapon slots are then fired in init order. Damage is worked out in between each shot and applied to the ships.
// If ships or tokens are destroyed before their turn to shoot then they won't be able to fire back. The movement AI will
// go after the most attractive primary target on the board, but if this token is not in range, then the ship will fire on
// the most attractive primary target within range (or secondary if none available). Starbases have a +1 range bonus to all
// their weapons (this also gets applied to minefield sweeping rates), though cannot move. The movement AI doesn't take this
// bonus into account when moving ships to close in on an enemy starbase.
//
// Damage for each shot is calculated by multiplying the number of weapons in the slot by the number of ships in the token
// by the amount of dp the weapon does. For beam weapons, this damage will dissipate by 10% over the range of the beam
// (for a range 2 beam - no dissipation at range 0, 5% dissipation at range 1 and 10% dissipation at range 2). Also
// capacitors and deflectors will modify the damage actually done to the enemy ship. Damage will be applied first to the
// tokens shield stack and then to armour only when the entire shield stack of the token is down. For missile ships,
// each missile fired will be tested to see if it will hit, the chance to hit is based on the base accuracy, the computers
// on the ship and the enemy jammers. Missiles that miss will do 1/8 of their damage to the shields and won't affect armour.
// For missiles that hit, upto half will be taken by the shields, the rest will go to the armour. For capital missiles
// any damage done after the shields are taken down will do double damage to the armour. Whole ship kills are worked out
// by adding up all the damage done to the armour by a single salvo (from a token's slot) and dividing this by the amount
// of armour each single ship in the token has left (total armour x token damage %). The number of complete ships the shot
// could kill will be removed from the enemy token, the rest of the damage will divided equally among the rest of the ships
// in the token and applied as damage. As token armour is stored in 1/512ths (about 0.2%s) of total armour and not as an
// exact dp figure (shields are stored as an exact figure), there may be some rounding of the damage after each salvo
// (AFAIK its always rounds up). This fact can be abused by creating lots of small fleet tokens with weak missiles
// and many slots, where each slot that hits will do 0.2% damage to the enemy token even if each individual missile
// would do less damage normally (especially the case with a beta torp shooting a large nub stack).
//
// After all the weapons that are in range have fired, the next round begins, starting with ship movement.
// The battle is ended when either the 16 round timer runs out, there is only one race left present on the battle board
// or if there are two or more races which have no hostile intentions towards each other.
//
// After a battle, salvage is created. This is equal to 1/3 of the current mineral costs of all the ships that where
// destroyed during the battle. This is left at the location of the battle and will decay over time, or if the battle
// happened over a planet, then the minerals will get deposited there.
//
// Any races that took part in a battle and had at least one ship that managed to survive (either through surviving
// till the end or retreating beforehand) has a potential to gain tech levels from ships that where destroyed during
// the battle. For the exact details of the formulas and chances involved see the Guts of Tech Trading.
//
// Movement speed and moves per round.
// 3/4 is      1110
// 1 is        1111
// 1 1/4 is    2111
// 1 1/2 is    2121
// 1 3/4 is    2212
// 2 is        2222
// 2 1/4 is    3222
// 2 1/2 is    3232
