## About

[Stars!](https://wikipedia.org/en/Stars!) is an interstellar, turn based strategy game and a member of the 4X genre (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate). The original Stars! game was released as shareware by Jeff Johnson and Jeff McBride with help from Jeffrey Krauss (collectively known as the Jeffs), with a retail version published in 1997. `craig-stars` attempts to remain as close to the original as possible in both UI and gameplay.

The [Stars! wiki](https://wiki.starsautohost.org/) and [Home World Forum](https://starsautohost.org/sahforum2/) are both great places for learning about Stars! gameplay. The wiki's [strategy guide](https://wiki.starsautohost.org/wikinew/ssg/ssg.htm) is a good starting point for new players to learn the basics, and the active [Stars! discord server](https://discord.gg/t8JpDS3d) is a great place to ask questions and start/join new multiplayer games. (For developers & contributors, there is also a channel for stars clone discussion.)

## Development/Contributing
Contributions of any form are welcome, even non-code ones such as bug reports & feature requests. If you have any issues to report or cool ideas to suggest, open an Issue report on the GitHub repository. 

For code contributions, all you need to get started is a good code editor (like Visual Studio Code - avaliable at [https://code.visualstudio.com/Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) or online at [https://vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev)) and a GitHub account.

Meanwhile, for those who are more technically inclined and want to test out changes themself before committing, consider running a local instance of `craig-stars` for development. See the [development](docs/development.md) page for more info.
