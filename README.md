## About

`craig-stars` is an interstellar, turn based strategy game and a member of the 4X genre (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate). The original [Stars!](https://wiki.starsautohost.org/) was written by Jeff Johnson and Jeff McBride with help from Jeffrey Krauss (collectively known as the Jeffs). `craig-stars` attempts to remain as close to the original as possible in both UI and gameplay.

The [Stars! wiki](https://wiki.starsautohost.org/) is a great place for learning about Stars! The [strategy guide](https://wiki.starsautohost.org/wikinew/ssg/ssg.htm) is a good starting point.

There is also an active [discord server](https://discord.gg/QUuat62H).
